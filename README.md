A Tom Swifty is a type of word play in which there is a punning relationship
between an adverb and the statement it refers to. The name comes from the Tom
Swift series of books where the scientist hero Tom Swifty undergoes adventures
involving rocket ships, ray-guns and other things he had invented.
